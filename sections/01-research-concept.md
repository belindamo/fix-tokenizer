# Research Concept & Direction

Research Problem & Objectives:
Debugging and improving tokenizer implementations in existing codebases. Core question: How can AI agents effectively diagnose and fix tokenization issues in complex software systems?

Knowledge Gap:
Limited research on AI-assisted debugging for natural language processing components, particularly tokenizers.

Research Goals:
Develop systematic tokenizer debugging methodologies
Create AI-agent compatible troubleshooting frameworks
Validate fixes through comprehensive testing

Scope: Specific repository and commit-based tokenizer improvement

Expected Contributions: AI-assisted debugging methodology for NLP components
